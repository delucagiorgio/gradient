# gradient
A Processing script to create a fascinating evolution of colors through a gradient function


## Some notes

1) "resolution" variable expresses the number lines needed inside the 2PI circle
2) "radiusResolution" variable expresses the number of steps needed to build a complete radius (the radius is actually divided for this number and for each division a circular rendering is performed)
3) "offsetAngle" is the angle from which the gradient starts
4) "lightDir" is the angle where the rendering will have the lightest part  
5) Choose from the data folder the noise texture you prefer to give the rendered sketch a more realistic effect
